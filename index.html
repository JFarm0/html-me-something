            <h2>A brief introduction...</h2>
            <p id="intro">Thank you for joining me on this little examination of one of my life's passions, bass guitar. For the sake of brevity and remaining within the scope of this assignment, I will keep the discussion based around the topic of bassists who have had an impact on me and my playing.</p>

                    <h3>Tim Commerford</h3>
                    <p>We begin with the individual I believe responsible for the largest portion of my foundation with the instrument: Tim Commerford of Rage Against the Machine and, to a lesser extent, Audioslave. With an agressive fingerstyle, tim.com best exemplified how to incorporate funk into metal and become part of, as Spin magazine once labeled RATM, "The World's Most Dangerous Band."</p>

                    <h3>Les Claypool</h3>
                    <p>This eccentric gentleman has always demonstrated the limits of what the insturment can do. With an array of techniques including Flamenco strumming and two handed tapping, Les Claypool of Primus and countless other groups, has driven a musical sound that is both eclectic and dumbfounding. Also, the man is super funky. </p>

                    <h3>Justin Chancellor</h3>
                    <p>Another musician who has pushed the boundaries of what I understand the instrument can accomplish is the bassist of TOOL, Justin Chancellor. With odd time signatures, rhythms that go against the rest of the band and switching roles mid-song with his guitarist, Justin shows what is possible in evocative and challenging music.</p>
