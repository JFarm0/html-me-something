            <h1>A brief introduction...</h1>
            <p>Thank you for joining me on this little examination of one of my life's passions, the bass guitar. For the sake of brevity and while remaining in the scope of this assignment, I will keep the discussion based around two topics: bassists who have had an impact on me and instruments that I have played.</p>

                    <h2>Tim Commerford</h2>
                    <p>The individual that I believe occupies the largest portion of my foundation with the instrument is Tim Commerford of Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave. With an agressive style, tim.com best exemplified how to incorporate funk into metal and still sound "dangerous." Hear him below. Warning: Explicit lyrics.</p>

                    <h2>Les Claypool</h2>
                    <p>This avant-garde gentleman has always shown me the limits of what the insturment can do. With an array of techniques including Flamenco strumming and two handed tapping, he has driven a musical sound that is eclectic and awe-inspiring. I know I'll never play at his caliber, but I still like to listen and dream. Also, he's super funky. Hear him below in arguably his most-famous band, Primus. Warning: bizarre.</p>

                    <h2>Justin Chancellor</h2>
                    <p>Another musician who has pushed the boundaries of what I understand the instrument can accomplish is the bassist of Tool, Justin Chancellor. With odd time signatures, rhythms that go against the rest of the band and oftentimes switching roles mid-song with the guitarist, Justin shows me what is possible in metal and hard music. Hear him below.</p>
