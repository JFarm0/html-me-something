            <p id="intro">Thank you for joining me on this quick examination of one of my passions, the bass guitar. For the sake of brevity, I will keep the discussion based around the topic of bassists who have had an impact on me and my playing.</p>

                    <h3>Tim Commerford</h3>
                    <p>The individual I believe responsible for the largest portion of my foundation with the instrument is Tim Commerford of Rage Against the Machine and, to a lesser extent, Audioslave. With an agressive fingerstyle and sound, tim.com best exemplified how to incorporate a sense of funk into metal and become part of, as Spin magazine once labeled RATM, "The World's Most Dangerous Band."</p>

                    <h3>Les Claypool</h3>
                    <p>This eccentric gentleman has always demonstrated the limits of what bass can do. With an array of avant-garde techniques including Flamenco strumming and two-handed tapping, Les Claypool of Primus, and countless other groups, has driven a musical sound that is both eclectic and dumbfounding. Never knew I could enjoy so many songs about fishing. </p>

                    <h3>Justin Chancellor</h3>
                    <p>Another musician who has pushed the boundaries of my understanding of what a bassist can be is Justin Chancellor of TOOL. With odd time signatures, rhythms that go against the rest of the band and switching musical roles with his guitarist mid-song, Justin shows what is possible in evocative and challenging heavy music.</p>
